> Privacy-preserving payroll platform built on Horizen

## What is PolyPay?

PolyPay is a privacy-preserving payroll platform that enables organizations, DAOs, and global teams to run payroll privately.

**The Problem:** Current on-chain payment solutions expose sensitive information — employee salaries, payment recipients, and multisig approvers are all publicly visible.

**Our Solution:** PolyPay uses zero-knowledge proofs to keep payment details confidential while maintaining on-chain security.

## Key Features

- **Private Payments** — Salary amounts and recipients stay confidential
- **Private Multisig** — Team approvals without exposing signer identities
- **Flexible Payment Logic** — Support for escrow, milestone-based, and recurring transfers

## Quick Start

1. Connect your Ethereum wallet
2. Create a new multisig or join an existing one
3. Propose, sign, and execute transactions privately
